Welcome to the first Machine Problem!

DUE DATE: Thu April 8, 11:59pm

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

You can submit an assignment from any of the cluster machines by using
our submit script. Th submit script bundles the entire current directory into
a submission. Thus, you use it by CDing to a the directory for your assignment,
and running:

  > cd *some directory*
  > /usr/class/cs193g/bin/submit mp1

This will submit the current directory as your assignment. You can submit
as many times as you want, and we will use your last submission.

RUNNING THE ASSIGNMENT
=======================

We want to get you up to speed with the nitty gritty details of the
environment required by CUDA. We've (hopefully) simplified this by
including a Makefile that configures the environment for the pups cluster
machines. We will provide a more general makefile in later problems.

You can use what we've provided in three ways:

1) RUNNING ON PUPS USING OUR MAKEFILE:
======================================

To compile the three problems (mp1-part1.cu, mp1-part2.cu and mp1-part3.cu), run:
   > make all

This will generate a "part1", "part2" and "part3" executable. When you run
this from the shell, it will most probably complain about some shared library.

To run any of the problems, you can also use the makefile, like so:
   > make run1
   > make run2
   > make run3

This will set the correct shared library path, and run each of the
executables.

2) MODIFYING MAKEFILE FOR YOUR OWN MACHINE:
===========================================

The details of the installation comes from CUDA's "Getting Started"
guides, available here:
http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda_3_0_downloads.html

You can modify our makefile for your own use (which assumes you're running on Mac or
Linux), by setting the NVCC and LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables in the makefile to their correct
paths for your machine.

For 64-bit installations:
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH	:=	/usr/local/cuda/lib64

For 32-bit installations:
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH	:=	/usr/local/cuda/lib

3) SETTING GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FOR CUDA WORK:
=============================================

Since you probably want to configure your computer to do cuda work in
general, or you might not want to always use the makefile to run an
executable, you can set the required environmental variables for your
shell using your .profile or .bashrc file.

You want to set the nvcc compiler to be part of your path, and you want to
set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the folder where the "libcudart.so"
file is.

For c-shell variants (the default on pups):

     setenv PATH $PATH:/usr/local/cuda/bin
     setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/cuda/lib

For bash variants (the default on macs):

    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda/bin
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib

If you're on a 64-bit architecture, you need to use the lib64 directory
rather than the lib directory.

Any issues should be addressed to the class mailing list (a TA will answer
it), or during office hours.
